# MKE Python August 2016 Meeup
Code is for the MKE Python August 2016 meetup. The intent is for folks to be able to follow along with the meetup demo if they so choose. 
 
You'll need to download PyCharm and have Python installed.

Note, some of the code in the demo is Python 3 code.  


## Support

Only at the meetup.  :-)
